# Health Facility Resilience to Power Outages in the United States

This project aims to address the critical challenge of natural disasters disrupting both energy supply and health services. It proposes developing an emergency power allocation model, especially drawing from renewable energy sources, for mobile health units and backup systems in the U.S. 


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Can we accurately predict which U.S. health entities are most vulnerable during a hazardous natural disaster and the amount of renewable emergency power allocated for mobile backup units?
